======================

Hi people and thanks for downloading the female Scientist model pack.											December, 1st, 2017


I'd like to point out that I'm not the author of the models nor textures. How ever I did merge em together out of various other model packs and official Valve files. That includes everything from animation rigging and head/body merging till applying their textures.

Credits:

Credits go to Valve/Gearbox.

Credits go to Romka. ------------- http://old.ambientimpact.com/

Credits go to Corvalho for hacking that new face into cs 1.6. --------- https://gamebanana.com/skins/108725
It allowed me to port it to to default hl1 and then add facial animations to a formerly motionless face.

Major credits go to the Science and Industry mod team: I used their female body proportion meshes (Chest) as basis for my scientists. ------------- http://scienceandindustrygame.com <<< Play their mod kinda cool game.

Contents:

4 Female Scientists in typical Black Mesa dress code.

Submodels contain:
Gina, Colette, Barniel & the new female face, I call her Katja.

The model has all the typical Scientist Animations...

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

Bugs: Submodel 4 Katja has no working Eyelids. I tried fixing it for numerous hours but for some illogical reason it refuses to work as intended.
But that's only a minor cosmetic issue and has no impact on the gameplay and players should hardly notice.

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
Terms of use:

Since this model pack is based upon the work of countless other people it is obvious that I release this on a "free to use" basis for everyone.
Who knows somebody out there might be willing and able to fix the eyelids for submodel4 or even enhance up upon the Scientists to womanize them even more by giving them skirts, blouses etc. You're hereby authorized to do so. It would be nice if you credit me and the other people their original work. Should you do release something let me know so that I can download it and implement it to my hl1 SP mods. :)

Best regards
